# Upstream findings

These defects and surprises in the stock components were observed while qualifying OMP 18.4.0 (`401778d`)
against Strata v0.1.27 (`a790805`). Each has a reproducer in this repository. The Strata items are reported
upstream as linked below, after re-verification at the same Strata commit. The OMP items go upstream as pull
requests rather than issues, as upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md` asks for work the reporter will submit.
The integration works around them only where a supported setting exists.

## Strata

1. **A queued client's disconnect poisons the next long request and crashes the engine.** Reproduced 2/2 by
   `scripts/realhost_gates.py g14q`; the control case is clean. Upstream: same root cause as
   [Strata#183](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/183), with fixes proposed in #194 and #205.
   - Steps: request A is generating and request B is queued behind it; B's client disconnects. Then the next
     request whose prompt needs more than one prefill window (about 8K tokens here) fails with HTTP 400
     `cancelled`, the engine exits with code 1, and the request after that gets HTTP 503 before the lazy restart.
   - Short prompts in between are served normally.
   - Cause: B reaches the engine after A and is stopped while it reads its prompt, which leaves the engine's `err`
     string set to `cancelled`. The next request clears `stop_req` but not `err`
     (`src/program/generate.cpp:3561`), so a prompt read in batched chunks fails on its first chunk and the serve
     loop exits with code 1 (`:3996-4000`). The windowed path used for short prompts does not check `err` first.
   - Workaround here: `omp_strata.py restart`.
2. **Tool calls cut off mid-arguments are finalized as complete.** When the model ends its turn inside a tool
   call, `OutputParser.finish()` closes the partial JSON and the response reports `finish_reason: tool_calls`.
   Clients then execute truncated arguments; see OMP item 1. Reproducer:
   `tests/mock/test_strata_frontend_mock.py::test_model_stop_inside_qwen_tool_body` (the stock frontend with
   its MockEngine). A cut on `finish_reason: length` is correctly reported. Upstream:
   [Strata#210](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/210), which also covers `</parameter>` or `</tool_call>`
   inside an argument; our #211 was closed as its duplicate, noting that the finish reason must change as well.
3. **`/status` is unauthenticated and includes a tail of the generated text.** With an API key set, any local
   process can still read the last 600 characters of the current answer, and of the most recent one while the
   server is idle, because the tail is not cleared when a request ends. Upstream:
   [Strata#212](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/212).
4. **An empty API key disables authentication, and keys are compared with `==`.** The "no API key" warning is
   printed only for non-loopback hosts. The integration refuses to start without a key of at least 32
   characters. Upstream: [Strata#213](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/213).
5. Stock `setup.py` resolves the engine from `releases/latest`, the model and MTP tensors from `main`, and
   unpinned PyPI packages, and it writes to `%APPDATA%\Strata`. The integration feeds it pinned, verified local
   inputs instead. Upstream: [Strata#214](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/214).
6. **Every unexpected engine exit is logged as a probable out-of-memory event**, including the stale-cancel crash
   in item 1 and deliberate kills. None of the 5 exits observed here was memory-related. Upstream:
   [Strata#215](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/215).

## OMP

Re-verified against OMP `main` (`2b023d1`, 2026-09-30); each item notes its status there.

1. **Executes tool calls whose arguments are syntactically truncated.** At finalization OMP parses the argument
   string with its lenient streaming parser, which closes unterminated JSON, and runs the call: a partial file
   write happens and the run exits 0. Reproducer:
   `tests/mock/test_g04_faults.py::test_truncated_arguments_must_not_execute_side_effect`. A `length` cut is handled
   correctly (`::test_finalized_partial_json_with_length`). `::test_finalized_partial_json_with_stop` is the composed
   case from Strata item 2: the server closes the JSON itself, so OMP receives valid JSON and cannot tell; that half
   needs the Strata fix. Still present on `main`.
2. **Contacts the internet at startup.** The background model-registry refresh (`refreshInBackground`) fetches the
   public model catalog from `catalog.stencil.so` when its cache is cold or stale, and implicit local providers probe
   127.0.0.1:11434, :8080 and :1234; no startup setting disables either. Observed with ETW in G13. Workaround here:
   proxy variables pointing at a closed loopback port. Upstream, can1357/oh-my-pi#10934 asks for a catalog opt-out.
3. **Sends `Bearer STRATA_API_KEY` literally when a models.yml `apiKey` names an unset variable**, instead of
   failing. This is OMP's documented contract (an `apiKey` is tried as an environment variable name, else sent as the
   literal token), which is why `launch-omp` refuses a missing key. Reproducer:
   `tests/mock/test_g02_isolation.py::test_raw_stock_missing_key_dispatches_literal_and_fails_401`.
4. **Retries on `openai-completions` cannot be turned off.** An HTTP 500 produced 12 identical requests (6
   transport attempts × 2 provider attempts) with `retry.enabled: false`. The transport's `DEFAULT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
   (`packages/ai/src/utils/openai-http.ts`) reads no retry setting, so `retry.maxRetries` cannot reach it either.
   Reproducer: `test_g04_faults.py::test_http_500`. Still present on `main`; related: can1357/oh-my-pi#13255.
5. **The fitted `max_tokens` can overshoot a strict server by a few tokens.** The fit is
   `agent/src/output-budget.ts` `fitOutputTokensToContextWindow`. Near the window, prompt 105,522 + fitted cap
   25,563 exceeded Strata's 131,064 (131,072 − 8) by 21 tokens, and the closing turn failed with HTTP 400 (G17
   attempt 3). Fixed upstream by can1357/oh-my-pi#13499 (a 64-token headway, in 18.4.4). While the profile pins
   18.4.0, the integration keeps declaring the window 1,024 tokens below the engine's.
6. **Strata's overflow message is not classified as a context overflow.** `ai/src/error/flags.ts` has no pattern
   for "prompt (N tokens) + max tokens (M) exceeds the context", so no compaction recovery is attempted. This is
   minor, because item 5's fit usually prevents the overflow. Still present on `main`.
7. **Unknown `models.yml` compat keys are accepted silently.** A misspelled key is kept without an error. The
   integration guards its emitted keys with a test. Still present on `main`.
8. `--thinking off` still sends `reasoning_effort: low` with this dialect; OMP documents this as requesting the
   lowest effort on generic effort endpoints. `--no-tools` disables the built-in tools, so it is not a way to limit
   egress.
